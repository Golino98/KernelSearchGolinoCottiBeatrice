\chapter{Kernel Search}

\section{Kernel Search}
The code provided during the course implements a generic kernel search
which uses GUROBI as solver, and has the following default paramenters:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Presolve = 2 (aggressive presolve)
	\item Time limit = 30 seconds
	\item Threads = 12
	\item MIPGap = \num{1e-12}
	\item Sort variables by profit and reduced cost
	\item Kernel size = 15\% of the number of variables (rounded to the nearest integer)
	\item Bucket size = 2.5\% of the number of variables (rounded to the nearest integer)
	\item Number of iterations = 2
	\item Time limit for each bucket = 5 seconds
\end{itemize}
The code was initially modified to implement the MKP model, and it was then
refactored to improve its quality and efficiency.
The algorithm itself and the parameters were not changed at this time.\\
