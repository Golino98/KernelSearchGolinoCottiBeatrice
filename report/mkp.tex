\chapter{The Multiple Knapsack Problem}
Given a set of \(m\) knapsacks with a known \(\text{capacity } c_{i}\) \((i=1,\dots,m)\) and a set of \(n\) items with
known \(\text{profit } p_{j}\) and \(\text{weight } w_{j}\) \((j=1,\dots,n)\) the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) consists in
selecting \(m\) disjoint subsets of items (one subset per knapsack) such that the total weight of the items in the knapsack
does not exceed its capacity, and the profit of the selected items is maximized.

\section{Mathematical model}
There are quite a few formulations for the MKP, with different degrees of
complexity and performance.
The formulation that was used in this project is the classical and most intuitive
one, that uses the following binary variables:
\[x_{ij}=
\begin{cases}
    1 & \quad \text{if item } j \text{ is packed into knapsack } i\\
    0 & \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

The model is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:obj}
    \max{z} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} p_{j} x_{ij}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cap}
    \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{j} x_{ij} \leq c_{i} \qquad i=1,\dots,m
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sel}
    \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{ij} \leq 1 \qquad j=1,\dots,n
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    x_{ij} \in \{0,1\} \qquad i=1,\dots,m \quad j=1,\dots,n
\end{equation}

The objective function~\eqref{eq:obj} maximises the profit of the items in the knapsacks.\\
Constraints~\eqref{eq:cap} impose that the capacity of each knapsack is respected, while constraints~\eqref{eq:sel}
ensure that each item is packed in no more than one knapsack.

\section{Real life examples}
The MKP has various real life examples, in various fields.

The most straightforward example might be the cargo organization for a transport company.
In this scenario, the knapsack may be the trucks or containers.
Their capacity is the effective capacity of the truck/container.
The items are the objects that must be delivered.
Their weight is the actual weight of the item, while the profit is the priority of the delivery.

Another example might be the project selection:
The knapsacks may be the years of development of the project, and their capacity is the available budget for
that year.
The items can be the available projects: the weight is the cost of the project, the profit is the monetary gains
from the project completion.
