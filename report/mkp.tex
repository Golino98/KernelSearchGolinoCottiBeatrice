\chapter{The Multiple Knapsack Problem}
The description of the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP), as described in~\cite{mkp:2019}, is the following:\\
given a set of \(m\) knapsacks with a known \(\text{capacity } c_{i}\) \((i=1,\dots,m)\) and a set of \(n\) items with
known \(\text{profit } p_{j}\) and \(\text{weight } w_{j}\) \((j=1,\dots,n)\) the MKP consists in
selecting \(m\) disjoint subsets of items (one subset per knapsack) such that the total weight of the items in the knapsack
does not exceed its capacity, and the profit of the selected items is maximized.

\section{Mathematical model}
There are quite a few formulations for the MKP, with different degrees of
complexity and performance.\\
The formulation that was used in this project is the classical and most intuitive
one, that uses the following binary variables:
\[x_{ij}=
\begin{cases}
    1 & \quad \text{if item } j \text{ is packed into knapsack } i\\
    0 & \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

The mathematical model is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:obj}
    \max{z} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} p_{j} x_{ij}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cap}
    \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{j} x_{ij} \leq c_{i} \qquad i=1,\dots,m
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sel}
    \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{ij} \leq 1 \qquad j=1,\dots,n
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    x_{ij} \in \{0,1\} \qquad i=1,\dots,m \quad j=1,\dots,n
\end{equation}

The objective function~\eqref{eq:obj} maximises the profit of the items in the knapsacks.\\
Constraints~\eqref{eq:cap} impose that the capacity of each knapsack is respected, while constraints~\eqref{eq:sel}
ensure that each item is packed in no more than one knapsack.

\section{Real life examples}
The MKP has various real life examples and it can be used in different fields.

The most straightforward example is the \textbf{cargo organization} for a transport company.
In this scenario, the knapsacks are the trucks or containers.
Their capacity is the effective capacity of the truck/container.\\
The items are the objects that must be delivered:
their weight is the actual weight (or volume) of the goods that need to be shipped, while the profit is the priority of the delivery.

Another example is the \textbf{project selection}: the knapsacks are
the years available for the development of projects,
and their capacity is the available budget for that year.\\
The items are the available projects: the weight is the cost of the project, the profit is the monetary gain
from the project completion.
