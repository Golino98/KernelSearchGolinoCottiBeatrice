\chapter{Introduction}

In this report we describe the process of adapting the Kernel Search,
a generic heuristic framework that can be successfully used on a variety of
problems, to the specific model of the Multiple Knapsack Problem.\\
While Kernel Search provides good solutions in a short amount of time,
tuning becomes necessary to improve the performance of the algorithm
and the quality of the solution found.

In the first chapter, the Multiple Knapsack Problem is introduced,
along with a few real life examples to better explain the model.\\
Chapter~\ref{ch:kernel-search} contains a brief description of the Kernel Search algorithm,
along with a few basic improvements to the default algorithm.\\
In chapter~\ref{ch:implementation} we describe the technical
specifications of our implementation of the Kernel Search algorithm,
while in chapter~\ref{ch:computational-experiments} we study
the performance of the implementation and the test instances used as benchmark.\\
Finally, in chapter~\ref{ch:improvements} we report all
the methods that we have theorized to better adapt the Kernel Search
algorithm to the Multiple Knapsack Problem.
