\chapter{Introduction}
In the first chapter the Multiple Knapsack Problem is introduced,
along with a few real life examples to better explain the problem.\\
Chapter~\ref{ch:kernel-search} contains a brief description of the Kernel Search algorithm,
along with a few basic improvements to the default algorithm.\\
In chapter~\ref{ch:implementation} we describe the technical
specifications of our implementation of the Kernel Search algorithm,
while in chapter~\ref{ch:computational-experiments} we study
the performance of the implementation and the test instances used as benchmark.\\
Finally in chapter~\ref{ch:improvements} we report all
the methods that we have theorized to better adapt the Kernel Search
algorithm to the Multiple Knapsack Problem.
