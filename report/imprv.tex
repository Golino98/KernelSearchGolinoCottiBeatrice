\chapter{Improvements}

In this section we will describe the various changes
that we applied to the default kernel search implementation,
with the objective of improving its performance
in solving the MKP instances.

For the sake of completeness, we well also describe the all attemps at improving
the algorithm, thus including the unsuccesful ones.

The effectiveness of the tuning is demonstrated using the selected instances
described in~\ref{subsec:inst} as benchmark.


\section{Variable Sorting}
Description of the various sorting methods tried, both the good and the bad ones.
