\section{Kernel Search}
The code for the kernel search was provided by the teacher.\\
The code implements a generic kernel search, with the following default paramenters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Presolve = 2
    \item Time limit = 30 seconds
    \item Threads = 12
    \item Sort variables by profit and reduced cost
    \item Kernel size = 15\% of the number of variables
    \item Bucket size = 2.5\% of the number of variables
    \item Number of iterations = 2
    \item Time limit for each bucket = 5
\end{itemize}

The code was modified to implement the MKP model, and it was then
refactored to improve its quality and efficiency.
The kernel search algorithm itself and the default parameters were not changed
at this time.
The updated code can be found at the GitHub repository
